JU

justus-eapen

AI
I apologize for the confusion. Let me guide you through a simple way to check the /api/trending endpoint:

Open a new terminal or command prompt.
Run the following command:
curl http://localhost:5000/api/trending
This command will send a GET request to the /api/trending endpoint and display the response. You should see a JSON array of 8 GIF objects, each containing properties like id, title, tags, and images.

If you're unable to use the curl command, you can also open a web browser and navigate to:
http://localhost:5000/api/trending

This will display the JSON response directly in your browser.

After checking the response, please let me know if you see the expected data or if you encounter any issues.

how are we storing new images

12 hours ago
•
Read
JU

justus-eapen

AI
Currently, we are not storing the new images on the server's file system. When a user uploads an image, we're saving the file path in our MOCK_IMAGES list, which is held in memory. This means that uploaded images are not persisted and would be lost if the server restarts.

For a more robust solution, we should implement proper file storage. Here's a suggestion for improvement:

Save uploaded files to a specific directory on the server (e.g., 'static/uploads/').
Generate a unique filename for each uploaded image to avoid conflicts.
Store the URL path to the saved file in the MOCK_IMAGES list instead of the local file path.
Implement a database (like SQLite or PostgreSQL) to persistently store image metadata, including file paths, tags, and other relevant information.
Would you like me to implement these improvements to properly store and manage uploaded images?

I understand your preference for using S3 buckets or another form of long-term asset storage. This is indeed a better approach for a production environment. I'll make sure our team implements this change before proceeding with the infinite scrolling feature. This will provide better scalability and reliability for our image storage.

To use S3 for image storage, we need your AWS credentials and S3 bucket information. Please provide the following secret keys: AWS_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_SECRET_KEY, and S3_BUCKET. These will be securely stored as environment variables and used to configure the S3 integration.
